		<h1>Contextual inquiry</h1>

		<p class="small">Requirements: Half sheets of paper</p>

		<h2>Choose a partner (2 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Find someone you don't know. It's important that they're a stranger, as contextual inquiries are generally always with strangers. You'll want to get used to establishing rapport with someone you don't know.</p>

		<h2>Contextual inquiry 1 (25 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Choose who will go first. That person should choose a task that satisfies the following constraints:
			
		<ul>
			<li>They actually have to do the task</li>
			<li>They would actually do the task on campus on the device they're using</li>
			<li>The task should take about 20 minutes</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Examples of tasks include a homework assignment, a personal chore, some shopping they intended to do, etc.</p>

		<p>The other person should conduct a contextual inquiry on their task:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Like an interview, define a focus. There's too much to observe to see everything, so you have to decide what to pay attention to.</li>
			<li>Create a <em>partnership</em> between you and your informant. You act as an interested learner, they act like a knowledgable expert. It should feel like a master/apprentice relationship.</li>
			<li>Perform an inquiry in a real context. Every time you're confused, ask a question. Have them teach you.</li>
			<li>Don't generate questions in advance; think of them as you observe.</li>
			<li>Focus on questions about the work that is happening in context.</li>
			<li>Record audio, photos, notes, and any other raw data you can use later to interpret</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Contextual inquiry 2 (25 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Now swap, having the other person do the same.</p>
		
		<h2>Reflect (15 min)</h2>
		
		<p>Find a team to pair up with and discuss the following:</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>What did it feel like to observe?</li>
			<li>What did it feel like to be observed?</li>
			<li>What did you learn about your focus?</li>
			<li>What was difficult about doing the inquiry?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>After discussing with your classmates, we'll come back together and discuss these questions as a class.</p>

		<h2>Credit</h2>
		
		<p>Sign the activity sheet for credit.</p>
