		<h1>Critique your prototype</h1>

		<ol>
			<li>Prepare your prototype to share</li>
			<li>Outline a brief script for how you're going to introduce the design to your representative user.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>How will you introduce the idea?</li>
				<li>What questions will you ask about it?</li>
				<li>What kind of feedback are you looking for?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Get feedback from your representative user.</li>
			<li>Discuss your feedback with your partner.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you think your user understood your idea?</li>
				<li>Would your idea substantively address a problem they have?</li>
				<li>Are there ways to improve your idea to more directly and effectively address the problem you chose?</li>
			</ul>
			<li>If necessary, reconsider your design again, refining your concept or choosing a new one altogether.</li>
			<li>Once you've committed to a concept, enumerate all of the mockups you need to communicate every detail of your design. We'll use these in class next week to run an walkthrough.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>What are all of the screens a user would encounter?</li>
				<li>What are all of the inputs and outputs that are possible?</li>
				<li>What is your plan for creating all of these screens? Who will make them and with what tools?</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
