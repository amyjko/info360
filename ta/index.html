		<h1>TA responsibilities</h1>

		<ul>
			<li><b>When</b> will you be away this quarter?</li>
			<li>Weekly teaching huddle to discuss flailing students, plans (<b>when</b>?)</li>
			<li>About our undergraduates: tech fluent, occasionally code-phobic</li>
			<li>Class learning objectives: design thinking skills</li>
			<li>Pedagogical approach and rationale: reading > lecturing, activities > exams</li>
			<li>One-time responsibilities</li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Review</b> the syllabus for ambiguity ((<strong>Rachel and Ada</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Grade</b> the pre- and post test (<strong>Rachel</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Assess</b> the midterm's validity and reliability by analyzing which questions were too easy, too hard, based on pre-test (<strong>Rachel</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Report</b> midterm grades and pre-test grades to students with feedback about what they got wrong. (<strong>Rachel</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Teach</b> when I'm away (<strong>Rachel and Ada</strong>)</li>
				<li><b>Critique</b> drafts of students' design specifications (<strong>Rachel, Ada, and Andy</strong>)</li>
				<li>Help final grading of video prototypes and specifications during finals week (<b>when</b>?) (<strong>Rachel, Ada, and Andy</strong>)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Carefully familiarize yourself with the rubric on the syllabus. I like to keep it open while grading so I can refer to the rules.</li>
					<li>I find it easiest to print the PDFs, rather than using a PDF annotation tool. It's just faster.</li>
					<li>When you see a violation, write the name of the violation from the rubric (e.g., SUPPORT, LOGIC, RATIONALE) and write a few words to convey why it's a violation. I'll use this to explain to students why they lost the points. (I make them come to my office if they want an explanation). You don't need to provide feedback like you did this past week.</li>
					<li>Use colored ink to make them easy to find.</li>
					<li>After finishing one, add up all the points they lost and put a total on the front.</li>
					<li>Make note of any violations you were unsure about and we'll discuss them on Friday.</li>
					<li>Bring the annotated printouts to the grading meeting as your ground truth.</li>
				</ul>
